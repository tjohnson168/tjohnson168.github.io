### Project #5: Expected Risk of Hurricanes in Southeastern States
![Screenshot of project](images/project1.png)  
This project analyzed the risk expectancy of hurricanes in southeastern states using Python and NRI datasets. Our findings revealed that Florida had the highest risk expectancy score, followed by South Carolina. One surprising result was that South Carolina's risk expectancy was significantly higher than Louisiana's, which contradicted common media and public assumptions about Louisiana's recovery after Hurricane Katrina.
